# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the data processing pipeline sources to achieve consistent validation patterns and proper separation of concerns between parsing and validation. The current implementation has inconsistencies where data transformation occurs in both parse and validate methods, leading to unclear responsibilities and duplicate code patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Transformation Separation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the data processing pipeline, I want data transformation to be clearly separated from validation, so that the code is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing data THEN all data transformation (trimming, case conversion, splitting) SHALL occur in parse methods
2. WHEN validating data THEN validation methods SHALL only validate data structure and business rules without transforming data
3. WHEN a source processes data THEN the parse method SHALL return clean, transformed data ready for validation
4. WHEN validation occurs THEN it SHALL work with already-transformed data from the parse step

### Requirement 2: Consistent Validation Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer working with multiple data sources, I want all sources to follow the same validation patterns, so that I can easily understand and modify any source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing validation THEN all sources SHALL follow the same validation structure and error handling patterns
2. WHEN validating arrays of items THEN all sources SHALL use consistent error collection and warning patterns
3. WHEN reporting validation results THEN all sources SHALL provide the same metadata structure
4. WHEN handling validation errors THEN all sources SHALL use the same error categorization and logging approach

### Requirement 3: Duplicate Code Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want to eliminate duplicate validation code across sources, so that changes only need to be made in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common validation patterns exist THEN they SHALL be extracted to shared utility functions
2. WHEN validating data structures THEN common validation logic SHALL be reused across sources
3. WHEN handling validation errors THEN error handling patterns SHALL be centralized
4. WHEN logging validation results THEN logging patterns SHALL be consistent and reusable

### Requirement 4: Validation Utility Framework

**User Story:** As a developer implementing new data sources, I want a validation utility framework, so that I can easily implement consistent validation without duplicating code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating validation utilities THEN they SHALL provide common validation functions for typical data types
2. WHEN validating arrays THEN utilities SHALL provide consistent error collection and reporting
3. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN utilities SHALL provide reusable duplicate detection functions
4. WHEN formatting validation results THEN utilities SHALL provide consistent metadata formatting

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the refactored validation to maintain the same external behavior, so that existing integrations continue to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring validation THEN the output data structure SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN processing sources THEN the same validation errors and warnings SHALL be reported
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the same error types and messages SHALL be thrown
4. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the same validated data format SHALL be returned

### Requirement 6: Performance Maintenance

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the refactored validation to maintain or improve performance, so that data processing times do not increase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring validation THEN processing performance SHALL not degrade
2. WHEN using shared utilities THEN they SHALL not introduce performance overhead
3. WHEN validating large datasets THEN memory usage SHALL remain efficient
4. WHEN processing multiple sources THEN validation SHALL not become a bottleneck
