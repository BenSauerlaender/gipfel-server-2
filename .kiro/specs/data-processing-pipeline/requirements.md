# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to restructure and improve the existing data processing system that handles data from multiple external sources (OSM, Teufelsturm, climbing data, etc.) and imports it into the database. The current system has grown organically and lacks consistency, proper documentation, and maintainability. The new system will provide a flexible, well-structured, and maintainable data processing framework that can adapt as the project evolves.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a flexible data processing framework, so that I can easily understand, maintain, and extend data processing workflows as the project evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is restructured THEN it SHALL have a clear and consistent code organization
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the structure SHALL be intuitive and self-documenting
3. WHEN adding new functionality THEN the system SHALL accommodate changes without major refactoring
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what went wrong

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple configuration management, so that I can easily modify processing behavior without extensive code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring processing THEN the system SHALL support a straightforward configuration approach
2. WHEN adding new data sources THEN configuration changes SHALL be minimal and intuitive
3. WHEN processing data THEN key parameters SHALL be easily configurable
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support different environment configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling and logging, so that I can quickly understand and fix issues in the data processing system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL log meaningful progress information
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide useful feedback about the results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want data validation capabilities, so that I can ensure data quality and consistency before importing into the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing raw data THEN the system SHALL validate data against defined schemas
2. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log validation errors and optionally skip invalid records
3. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL apply consistent validation rules across all data sources
4. WHEN data is ready for import THEN it SHALL conform to the expected database schema

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file-based caching capabilities, so that I can avoid redundant processing and improve system performance while ensuring data freshness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL cache intermediate and final results to the file system
2. WHEN the same data source is processed again THEN the system SHALL use cached results if they are still valid
3. WHEN configuration files change THEN the system SHALL invalidate related cached data automatically
4. WHEN source data dependencies change THEN the system SHALL detect changes and invalidate dependent cached results
5. WHEN cache invalidation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the reason and affected cache entries
6. WHEN configuring caching THEN cache behavior SHALL be configurable per data source or processing step

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can understand how to use, maintain, and extend the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN each module SHALL have clear documentation explaining its purpose and usage
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN configuration options SHALL be well-documented with examples
3. WHEN working with caching THEN cache configuration and invalidation rules SHALL be clearly documented

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing capabilities, so that I can ensure the data processing pipeline works correctly and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing processing modules THEN each module SHALL have comprehensive unit tests
2. WHEN testing the pipeline THEN integration tests SHALL verify end-to-end processing workflows
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support testing with mock data sources
4. WHEN making changes THEN automated tests SHALL catch breaking changes before deployment
